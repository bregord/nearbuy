Site Description
-----
This website is used to post and view ads in a particular geographic distribution.
A user registers into our database, and logins with a secure key.
Once logged in, they have the option of viewing the map of ads, managing their own listings, 
or opening up a chat window to talk to directly to other users.
When managing their listings: the user can both view current ads, delete old ones, and create new ones.
When viewing ads: the user can search within a certain radius, and change their search location.
When using chat: the user must first log in, and can then send live messages to other users currently logged in.
